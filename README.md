## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Install [pipx](https://pypi.org/project/pipx/)

```shell
pip install pipx
```

> If installing from PyPI, we recommend installing uv into an isolated environment, e.g., with pipx

### 2. Installing [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

```shell
pipx install uv
```

### 2. Verify UV installation

```shell
uv
```

> if you run into error [The term 'uv' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program.] run **pipx list** to see where uv is installed and add the folder path to system evironment variables. Then, open a new terminal (or restart VS Code) and try again.

### 3. Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fastapi-starter-setup.git
cd fastapi-starter-setup
```

### 4. Create a project

```shell
python create_project.py <new_project_folderpath> <project_name>
